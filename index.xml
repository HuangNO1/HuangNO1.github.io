      <description>2019/04/09 edited by Huang Po-Hsun 相信我，肥宅我看了很多網站上教學，都是老舊的廢文，甚至如果照做就有可能造成出錯的問題。還有很多文章也沒有詳細講解該如何配置，關於 Linux 中的 GDB 配置在 VScode 的文章少之又少，錯誤百出。因此肥宅在這教導各位正確地在 Linux 環境下從安裝 VScode 到配置環境變量與 GDB 調試。 肥宅的 Linux 發行版資訊 肥宅使用的發行版是 ArchLinux，圖形界面是 KDE Plasma。 下載安裝 VScode 在 Konsole 輸入下載指令 sudo pacman -S code 註：因爲圖形界面的使用者一定是一般使</description>

      <description>The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy is a comedy science fiction series created by Douglas Adams. Originally a radio comedy broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, it was later adapted to other formats, and over several years it gradually became an international multi-media phenomenon. Adaptations have included stage shows, a &amp;ldquo;trilogy&amp;rdquo; of five books published between 1979 and 1992, a sixth novel penned by Eoin Colfer in 2009, a 1981 TV series, a 1984 computer game, and three series of three-part comic book adaptations of the first three novels published by DC Comics between 1993 and 1996. There were also two series of towels, produced by Beer-Davies, that are considered by some fans to be an &amp;ldquo;official version&amp;rdquo; of The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy, as they include text from the first novel.
Movie A Hollywood-funded film version, produced and filmed in the UK, was released in April 2005, and radio adaptations of the third, fourth, and fifth novels were broadcast from 2004 to 2005. Adams did many of these adaptations, including the novels, the TV series, the computer game, and the earliest drafts of the Hollywood film’s screenplay, and some of the stage shows introduced new material written by Adams.</description>
